# Deployment Guide for Remote VM

## Changes Summary

### üîß Critical Fix: Prisma Binary Targets
**Issue:** Registration failing with "Query Engine not found" error on remote VM
**Fix:** Added support for both x86_64 and ARM architectures in `prisma/schema.prisma`

```prisma
binaryTargets = ["native", "linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x", "linux-musl-arm64-openssl-3.0.x"]
```

This now supports:
- ‚úÖ x86_64/AMD64 VMs (your remote server)
- ‚úÖ ARM64/Apple Silicon (local development)

### üé® New Feature: Model Management UI
- Admin page at `/admin/models` for managing AI models
- Download popular models with one click
- View installed models and their sizes
- Delete models to free disk space
- Fully integrated with Ollama

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- Fixed Ollama API endpoints (was using wrong paths)
- Fixed Next.js 15 async params compatibility
- Fixed all TypeScript and ESLint errors

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to Git Remote (if using Git hosting)

If you're using GitHub/GitLab/etc:

```bash
# On your local machine
git remote add origin <your-git-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Remote VM

**Method A: Using Git (Recommended)**

```bash
# SSH into your remote VM
ssh user@your-vm-ip

# Clone the repository (first time)
git clone <your-repo-url> home-chat-server
cd home-chat-server

# Or pull updates (if already cloned)
cd home-chat-server
git pull origin main

# Clean rebuild to apply Prisma binary fix
docker compose down -v
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d

# Check logs
docker compose logs app | tail -50
```

**Method B: Manual File Transfer (if not using Git)**

```bash
# On your local machine, create an archive
tar -czf customchatai.tar.gz \
  --exclude=node_modules \
  --exclude=.next \
  --exclude=.git \
  .

# Transfer to remote VM
scp customchatai.tar.gz user@your-vm-ip:~/

# On remote VM
ssh user@your-vm-ip
tar -xzf customchatai.tar.gz -C home-chat-server
cd home-chat-server

# Clean rebuild
docker compose down -v
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check all containers are running
docker compose ps

# Should see:
# customchatai-app          running
# customchatai-db           running
# customchatai-model-runner running

# Check app logs for successful startup
docker compose logs app | grep "Ready in"

# Expected output:
# ‚úì Ready in 50-100ms

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Expected output:
# {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"..."}
```

### 4. Test User Registration

```bash
# Try registering a new user via the UI
# Navigate to: http://your-vm-ip:3000/auth/signup

# Or test via API:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "testpass123",
    "name": "Test User"
  }'

# Should return: {"message":"User created successfully"}
```

### 5. Download AI Models

**Option A: Via Admin UI (Recommended)**

1. Log in with an admin account
2. Navigate to: `http://your-vm-ip:3000/admin/models`
3. Click "Download" next to a model (recommend `llama3.2:3b` for testing)
4. Wait for download to complete (2-5 minutes for small models)

**Option B: Via Command Line**

```bash
# Download a model
docker compose exec model-runner ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Verify download
docker compose exec model-runner ollama list

# Should show:
# NAME           ID              SIZE
# llama3.2:3b    a80c4f17acd5    2.0 GB
```

### 6. Test Chat Functionality

1. Navigate to: `http://your-vm-ip:3000/dashboard`
2. Select a model from the dropdown (should show your downloaded model)
3. Send a test message: "Hello, how are you?"
4. Verify you receive a streaming response

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Query Engine not found" error persists

**Cause:** Old Docker image still cached

**Solution:**
```bash
# Force complete rebuild
docker compose down -v
docker system prune -a -f
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### Issue: No models showing in dropdown

**Cause:** No models downloaded yet

**Solution:**
```bash
# Download at least one model
docker compose exec model-runner ollama pull llama3.2:3b

# Refresh the dashboard page
```

### Issue: Model download fails

**Cause:** Network issues or invalid model name

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check Ollama container logs
docker compose logs model-runner

# Verify Ollama is responding
docker compose exec model-runner ollama list

# Try a smaller model
docker compose exec model-runner ollama pull phi3
```

### Issue: Container won't start

**Cause:** Port conflicts or missing environment variables

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check what's using the ports
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :5432
lsof -i :11434

# View detailed logs
docker compose logs app
docker compose logs db
docker compose logs model-runner
```

## Architecture Support

This deployment now supports:

| Architecture | Binary Target | Tested On |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| x86_64/AMD64 | `linux-musl-openssl-3.0.x` | ‚úÖ Cloud VMs, Intel servers |
| ARM64/Apple Silicon | `linux-musl-arm64-openssl-3.0.x` | ‚úÖ Mac M1/M2/M3 |

---

## Performance Tips

### For x86_64 VMs (Your Remote Server)
- Recommended: 4+ CPU cores, 8+ GB RAM
- Small models (3B params): 2-4 GB RAM during inference
- Medium models (7-8B params): 6-8 GB RAM during inference

### Model Recommendations by VM Size

**2 GB RAM VM:**
- Skip model downloads, use API proxying instead

**4 GB RAM VM:**
- `phi3` (2.3 GB) - Small but capable
- `llama3.2:3b` (2 GB) - Fast and efficient

**8 GB RAM VM:**
- `mistral` (4.1 GB) - High quality
- `llama3.2` (4.7 GB) - Balanced performance
- `codellama` (3.8 GB) - Code generation

**16+ GB RAM VM:**
- Any combination of the above
- `llama3.1:13b` (larger models)

## Security Checklist

Before production deployment:

- [ ] Change default PostgreSQL password in `.env`
- [ ] Set custom `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` in `.env` (or let it auto-generate)
- [ ] Configure OAuth providers (Google, GitHub) in `.env`
- [ ] Set up HTTPS/SSL with a reverse proxy (nginx, Caddy)
- [ ] Enable firewall rules (allow only 80, 443, 22)
- [ ] Set up regular database backups
- [ ] Monitor disk space (models can use 2-15 GB each)
